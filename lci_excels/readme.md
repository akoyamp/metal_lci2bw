# LCI Excel Files

This folder must contain the **Excel Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) files** used by the import script.

The Excel files should be copied from the following dataset:

Lai, F. (2025). *LCI datasets associated with the "Life cycle inventories of global metal and mineral supply chains: a comprehensive data review, analysis and processing" article* [Data set]. *Resources, Conservation and Recycling* (Version 0). Zenodo.
[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15075067](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15075067)

Only the Excel files required for import should be placed in this folder.

The import script reads all LCI Excel files directly from this directory. Files located elsewhere will not be detected.
Do not rename or modify the structure of the Excel files unless you also update the import logic accordingly.
